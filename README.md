Prework Study Guide

## Description
My motivation for the project was essentially outlinin the most important key terms and information from all four topics (HTML,CSS, Git, and Javascript). Building this project helped me further my skills in Git and practice coding in a different language. There is so much you can accomplish and this project seemingly proves it. Having access to the coding bootcamp notes whereever I am no matter distance or time allows me to go the extra step in learning successfully. Everything that I have documented I learned in some aspect. I got fraustrated when I hit a wall, happy when I managed to execute the code efficiently and correctly, and sad when I had to move on from certain segements. 

## Usage
Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. Navigate to the DevTools console, where you can see the JavaScript code running.
