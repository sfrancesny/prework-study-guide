        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
       <li>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.</li>
       <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples is an example of a tool created from JavaScript.

       <li>A string is a sequence of text. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>

        <li>Boolean is a true/false value. They do not require quotation marks like string variables.</li>
       <li>An array is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li> 
       <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code.</li>
       <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
